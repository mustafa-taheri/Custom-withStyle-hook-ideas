Material-UI v4 withStyles styles to regular CSS styles:

Custom Hook: useConvertedStyles
The useConvertedStyles hook is designed to convert Material-UI v4 withStyles styles into regular CSS styles that can be applied to components. It takes the styles parameter, which can be either a styles object or a function that accepts the theme as an argument and returns the styles object. The hook uses the current theme provided by the ThemeContext or the useTheme hook.

Pros:

Compatibility: The custom hook allows you to upgrade your React application from Material-UI v4 to v5 without using external libraries or migration tools.
Customization: You have full control over the conversion process, allowing you to customize the output according to your specific requirements.
Theme Support: The hook automatically handles theme-based values in styles, ensuring that the converted styles utilize theme properties.

Cons:

Manual Conversion: The custom hook requires you to manually update your components and replace the usage of withStyles with the converted styles using the useConvertedStyles hook.

Limited Migration Support: While the hook provides a solution for converting styles, it doesn't handle other aspects of the Material-UI v4 to v5 migration, such as component API changes or deprecated features. You will need to address those separately.

Overall, the custom hook provides a way to convert Material-UI v4 withStyles styles to regular CSS styles in a flexible and customizable manner. However, it requires manual effort to update your components and may not cover all aspects of the migration process.
